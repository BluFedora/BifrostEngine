# Overview
  > This document describes the API design of the Engine as a whole not on any specifics.
  > Typically you will need to add more functionality than what is described here but this is the baseline so that all engine Modules can interact with each-other in a sane way.
  > The member variables on any class is a suggestion while the __member functions are a requirement__.
  <!-- > If you are contributing to the Engine layer of this project you must follow the [Style Guide](rising_tide_style_guide_2018.pdf) -->
