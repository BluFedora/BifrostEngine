The behavior system should NOT rely on Ctors and Dtors.

Rather Behaviors must have a ctor that takes in nothing.

Like Unity we should have:

[https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ExecutionOrder.html]
> Awake  - The first time the object is made active (called before Start).
> Start  - Called the first frame that this Behavior is active.
> Update - Called every frame on an active behavior.

The separation between Awake and Start is that with Awake you do some initializaton but you cannot assume other Behaviors have been initialized.
Then in Start you can assume all 'Awake's have been called so that you can do some inter object communication.
