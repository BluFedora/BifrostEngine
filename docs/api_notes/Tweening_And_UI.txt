Need to have a good tweening lib. Easy to use with built in ways to tween: ("position", "scale", "rotation")
With a callback: OnComplete(DestroyPopup)

[https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/leantween-3595]

Ex:

startButton.onClick(
  [](const MouseEvent& evt)
  {
    Tween.doStartScreenAnimation(
      ...
    );

    evt.target.removeEventListener(evt.self/currentListener);
  }
);

To have animations be able to be undone after an interaction (press) we should always be animating towards a goal.
To "Undo" the goal is the starting value.



-------------------------------- Scripted Particles -------------------------------- 

To boot strap the first version an actual scripting language can be used with binding functions
with the sole purpose of emitting a simple particle bytecode.
